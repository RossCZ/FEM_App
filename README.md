# FEM App

Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical method for modelling various physical phenomena, such as structural mechanics, heat transfer or fluid behaviour. This app is a collection of smaller modules for demonstration of FEM possibilities and engineering applications.

Currently available modules include:
* Column
* Fire
* Wall
* Rope (under construction)
